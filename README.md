## A NOTE ON THE PROJECT PROCESS DEVELOPMENT:

- Although the first mvp is not yet finished, the state of the application if fully functional and, for the first mvp, it is complete.
- The ui was first implemented using a mobile-first approach. So, in order to properly visualize the current state of the app it is advised to:

  1. Activate the developer tools
  1. Set the iphone 6/7 profile

- Due to lack of available time I present the whole project in a single master branch. But I wanted to redo the project using multiple branches (master, develop and feature and feature/01_feature-description and so on), without erasing them, so that you can see I'm able to use control version. I'm able to use git flow too. Just in this case I would choose not to use it. I started the project in a testing repo (here it is: [testing-react-redux](https://github.com/drzoidberg/testing-react-redux.git)), but the commits are poorly formatted and often are undescriptive. I'm aware this is not a good practice. If I had more time I've formatted and described the branches & commits somewhat like this:

branch name example: `feature/building-Login-component`

commit example: `successfully built Login component`

other commit example: `building Login component: setting prop isLoading`
